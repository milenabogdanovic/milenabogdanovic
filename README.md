Hello I am Milena BogdanoviÄ‡.ðŸ‘‹
I am 21 years old.
I finished high school and after that I completed programming  course in the field of web site development.
This field interests me and I decided to dedicate myself to it, I want to learn everything I can because I want to become a programmer, and I know that there is a lot of learning ahead of me, but when you love something, you fight for it.
Here you can see some of my independent projects.
You can contact me via this email: milena.bogdanovic002@gmail.com
